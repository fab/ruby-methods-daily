Ruby Methods Daily
==================
Found yourself struggling to remember Ruby method names? Want to see more of the methods that Ruby has to offer? Or perhaps you're preparing for technical interviews and wish there was an easy way to revise Ruby methods without reading pages and pages of documentation?

Ruby Methods Daily is a daily email service that sends you three methods from popular Ruby classes/modules from the [Ruby Docs website](http://ruby-doc.org). External links to the docs are included with each method if you want to have a further look.
